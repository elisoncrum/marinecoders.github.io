&lt;p&gt;Marine Coders is excited to announce that it has officially partnered with Marine Innovation Unit (MIU) to form the MIU Marine Coders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This team will coordinate bringing on reserve software developers as a force provider for software activities and programs in the Marine Corps. We believe that these developers will be a game changer to create a better, more lethal Marine Corps. These positions are rank and MOS agnostic, meaning anyone with the right technical experience can make a difference. The partnership with MIU will advance both MIU and Marine Coder’s missionsets. We are proud to offer 2 reserve Selected Marine Corps Reserve (SMCR) positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This partnership will bring a few changes to the Marine Coders. First, this partnership cements the Marine Coders concept into the Marine Corps through official billets assigned to the Marine Coders. This is a huge step forward for Marine Coders from unofficial concept to official organization. As such, we’ve decided to rebrand our logo to showcase this. Second, this partnership allows us to move from an active duty centric model to a full range of employment through the reserves. We are excited with what we can accomplish in 2022 and beyond. Third, MIU Marine Coders will work under a force provider model. We believe this will allow us to accelerate existing efforts through the directed application of software developers who understand industry best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A special thank you to Major Jim Carlson for making this a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this in-person or remote?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are committed to employing the best talent we can find in support of the United States Marine Corps. Therefore, we are offering 80% remote work as part of the MIU Marine Coders, with the 20% being Annual Training (AT) and in person travel, only when required for mission success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do drill weekends work in MIU Marine Coders?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;MIU offers remote drill weekends, split up over the entire month. While this depends on the specific project you will be working under, you can expect to work an average of 4 hours per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will I be working on at MIU Marine Coders?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Software! Typing, moving, and communicating. We will ensure that you spend as much time as possible actually doing what you’re good at and solving problems, rather than spending time waiting for your computer to start up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the mission of the Marine Innovation Unit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Marine Innovation Unit (MIU) leverages existing Marine talent to address advanced technology challenges in order to accelerate the development of new capabilities.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Brig. Gen. Joseph Matos, Director, Information, Command, Control Communications and Computers (IC4) presents an award to members of the I MEF Coding Team as the victor of the inaugural Micro-Application Development Innovation Challenge at the Pentagon in Arlington, Va., Aug. 27, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dvids-just-released-an-article-highlighting-the-20-active-duty-marine-coders-that-participated-in-the-2021-micro-application-innovation-challenge&quot;&gt;DVIDS just released an article highlighting the 20+ Active Duty Marine Coders that participated in the 2021 Micro-Application Innovation Challenge.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) Coding Team’s readiness application was selected the winner of the inaugural Micro-Application Development Innovation Challenge formally announced via MARADMIN number 600/21, Oct. 19, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I MEF Coding Team’s readiness application leveraged the Marine Corps Business Operations Support Services (MCBOSS) Development-Security-Operations (DevSecOps) ecosystem to rapidly create a data comprehension and visualization tool called the Global Combat Support System Marine Corps (GCSS-MC) Reconciliation Operations Organization Tool (GROOT), drastically reducing the time and effort required by Marines to understand and report on readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Micro-Application Innovation Challenge was announced via MARADMIN 164/21 on March 25, 2021 requesting each MEF to assemble a coding team, regardless of rank or military occupational specialty (MOS), to research, engineer, test and deploy a micro-software application to optimize operations.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competition was tough and picking a winner was a very difficult for the voting panel. II MEF’s Command Data Visualization Tool and III MEF’s Marine Logistics Planning Tool (MLPT) put up a great fight.  Checkout &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marines.mil/News/Messages/Messages-Display/Article/2815694/2021-inaugural-micro-application-development-innovation-challenge-results/&quot;&gt;MARADMIN 600/21&lt;/a&gt; for more details. GROOT is live and can be accessed via CAC at https://groot.apps.stg.mach9.usmc.mil/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge proved that given the tools, environments, resouces, and time, Marines CAN:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build full stack, cloud native web applications ready for deployment to the organization’s network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Effectively navigate all six steps of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) methodology to achieve an authority to Operate (ATO) in just ~90 days!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Execute Git Flow and Trunk Based Development to succcessfuly build and collaborate on a product as a team&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leverage a Platform as a Service (PaaS) to build containerized apps using a DevSecOps pipeline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And much more…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thak you to all that supported the challenge throughout the 4 months, to include but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DC I C4 for their sponsorship of the initiative&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;(C)&lt;/strong&gt; Include hands-on coding demonstrations and challenges.
&lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; Update existing recordkeeping systems to track artificial intelligence and programming certification testing results in a manner that is comparable to the system used for tracking and documenting foreign language competency, and use that recordkeeping system to ensure that workforce coding and artificial intelligence comprehension and skills are taken into consideration when making assignments.
&lt;strong&gt;(3)&lt;/strong&gt; Implement a system of rewards, including appropriate incentive pay and retention incentives, for members of the Armed Forces and civilian employees of the Department of Defense who perform successfully on specific language coding proficiency and artificial intelligence competency tests and make their skills available to the Department.
&lt;strong&gt;(b)&lt;/strong&gt; Information sharing with other Federal agencies
The Secretary of Defense shall share information on the activities carried out under subsection (a) with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and the heads of such other organizations of the intelligence community as the Secretary determines appropriate, for purposes of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; making information about the coding language proficiency and artificial intelligence competency tests developed under such subsection available to other Federal national security agencies; and
&lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; encouraging the heads of such agencies to implement tracking and reward systems that are comparable to those implemented by the Department of Defense pursuant to such subsection.

&lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; is assigned duties requiring proficiency in that programming language.
&lt;strong&gt;(b)&lt;/strong&gt; Rate
The rate of special pay for an employee under this section shall be prescribed by the Secretary, but may not exceed 20 percent of the employee’s rate of basic pay.&lt;/p&gt;
