# This is Marine Coders website repo

We are a group of U.S. Marines who use code to improve the lives of our fellow Marines.

On our website we offer members links to opportunities (such as the USAF Platform One Residency Program and a free trial to Cloud Academy), as well as links to ongoing Marine Coders projects, special events, and learning resources. Resources include self guided courses for:
* Learning to code
* Agile and DevOps methodologies
* Web development, Mobile Development, Front End/Back End frameworks
* Platforms and infrastructure
* and [more!](https://marinecoders.github.io/learn/) 
We also provide a link to the DOD DevSecOps services page provided by the USAF.

## What We Do
* We build code to help Marines!
* We open source as much as possible [cio.gov](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/OSS/) [code.mil](https://code.mil)
* We are responsible users of existing open source code
* We help each other
