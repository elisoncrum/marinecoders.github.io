## GitHub Community Guidelines
GitHub hosts millions of projects and millions of developers world wide, and are proud of their contribution to a culture of collaboration and teamwork. In wanting people to "work better together," Github has developed a set of community guidelines, which you can review here: [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines)

## DevDogs' Code of Conduct
* DO NOT include any FOUO/CLASSIFIED information
* Treat everyone with respect: whether you have been here for six months or six minutes, everyone on this team is here to make the Marine Corps a better place for Marines. 
* Don't be afraid to ask questions: Reach out to other members with questions big or small. Everyone grows when people share their knowledge and skillsets with the team.
* Add comments when you make changes: Letting others know what you did when you made a change keeps everyone on the same page and enhances the team's agility. Comments also cut down on "bus factor"; when somebody gets hit by a bus, does the team know what they changed? Do they know why?
