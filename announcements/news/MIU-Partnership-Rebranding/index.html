<meta content="Marine Coders is excited to announce that it has officially partnered with Marine Innovation Unit (MIU) to form the MIU Marine Coders.  This team will coordinate bringing on reserve software developers as a force provider for software activities and programs in the Marine Corps. We believe that these developers will be a game changer to create a better, more lethal Marine Corps. These positions are rank and MOS agnostic, meaning anyone with the right technical experience can make a difference. The partnership with MIU will advance both MIU and Marine Coderâ€™s missionsets. We are proud to offer 2 reserve Selected Marine Corps Reserve (SMCR) positions.  Marine Coders Full Stack Software Developer  Marine Coders Data Scientist  This partnership will bring a few changes to the Marine Coders. First, this partnership cements the Marine Coders concept into the Marine Corps through official billets assigned to the Marine Coders. This is a huge step forward for Marine Coders from unofficial concept to official organization. As such, weâ€™ve decided to rebrand our logo to showcase this. Second, this partnership allows us to move from an active duty centric model to a full range of employment through the reserves. We are excited with what we can accomplish in 2022 and beyond. Third, MIU Marine Coders will work under a force provider model. We believe this will allow us to accelerate existing efforts through the directed application of software developers who understand industry best practices.  A special thank you to Major Jim Carlson for making this a reality.  FAQ  Is this in-person or remote?    We are committed to employing the best talent we can find in support of the United States Marine Corps. Therefore, we are offering 80% remote work as part of the MIU Marine Coders, with the 20% being Annual Training (AT) and in person travel, only when required for mission success.   How do drill weekends work in MIU Marine Coders?    MIU offers remote drill weekends, split up over the entire month. While this depends on the specific project you will be working under, you can expect to work an average of 4 hours per week.   What will I be working on at MIU Marine Coders?    Software! Typing, moving, and communicating. We will ensure that you spend as much time as possible actually doing what youâ€™re good at and solving problems, rather than spending time waiting for your computer to start up.   What is the mission of the Marine Innovation Unit?    The Marine Innovation Unit (MIU) leverages existing Marine talent to address advanced technology challenges in order to accelerate the development of new capabilities. More information about the unit and other open billets can be found at the MIU website." name="description"/>
